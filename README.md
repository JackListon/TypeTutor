# Typetutor

This project idea was to create an interactive touch typing tutorial called Type Tutor. 

[Video Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWzTOhNi5gI)

This project combines traditional typing speed tests with your webcam to recognise the location of each of your fingers at the point of a keypress.
It uses Hough transforms to calculate the location of each of your fingers at the moment of a key press to check which finger is being used.
Once you complete the typing test you will receive a percentage of how many key strokes were made with the correct finger accoridng to touch typing
